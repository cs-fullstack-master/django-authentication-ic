## Exercise 1
Create a DMV application that allows you to enter your bill and the amount you owe. Your main page should greet everyone to the application and have a link to sign up a new user or log in. When creating a user you should ask for their username, email, and password. Once logged in, allow the user to save a form with their bill name and amount they owe. The logged in user should see all bills they owe.
